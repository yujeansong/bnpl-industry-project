    "## Rank based on Brand Growth and Exposure \n",
    "This notebook produces a dataframe of merchant rankings based on metrics that maximize the BNPL firm's brand growth and exposure. Now that we have considered the financial aspect of maximizing revenue as well as the demographic aspect of customers, we also want to incorportate a marketing aspect into our ranking system. In this section, we will focus on metrics that will help promote our BNPL firm's brand growth and exposure. We believe that onboarding merchants who maximize the metrics below will help our firm to expand and grow.\n",
